        <h1>Anti-competitive behavior exhibited by overlay vendors</h1>

        <h2>Interference with web accessibility testing tools</h2>

        <p>Among the most notable anti-competitive behaviors exhibited
            by overlays is their interference with the operation of testing tools.  WAVE,
            by WebAIM, is one of the most popular web accessibility testing tools in the
            market and is available via a few delivery methods including a browser
            extension or a web service.</p>

        <p>Using the web service, a user needs only to enter the URL
            they want tested into the form on <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">https://wave.webaim.org/</a>.
            Upon doing so, the WAVE service will assess the code on the URL that was
            submitted and display the results of its automated assessment.</p>

        <p>As shown in the image example below, overly product UserWay
            interferes with WAVE, displaying a brightly colored message declaring
            &quot;Scan Error. The Wave online scanner is unable to accurately parse the
            accessibility remediations on this page&quot;. This warning message is
            generated by UserWay, not WAVE, and is false.  The placement, appearance, and
            wording of this message is likely intended to erode customer's trust in the
            WAVE product.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Although the above message makes the recommendation to
            &quot;Use the Wave Browser Extension…&quot;, UserWay interferes with that tool
            as well.  The example images below show the homepage from <a
                href="https://data.unicef.org/">https://data.unicef.org/</a> on November 4,
            2021, at 4:09 PM US Central Time.  The first picture shows the default state of
            the page before the WAVE testing tool has been activated.  Pay particular
            attention to the white text on blue background on the right side of the center
            of the page.  This color combination fails WCAG standards for color contrast
            requirements.</p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <ul>
            <p>When the WAVE tool is activated, UserWay alters the page in
                a way that interferes with WAVE's ability to accurately test the page.  UserWay
                injects code onto the page that causes the white-on-blue text to be white text
                on a black background, as shown in the figure below.  This has the effect of:</p>

            <li>Tricking
                the UserWay customer into believing that the UserWay product is fixing things
                when, in its non-interfering behavior it isn't
            </li>

            <li>Interfering
                with the effectiveness and accuracy of another product
            </li>

            <li>(As
                a result of #2) convincing the UserWay customer that they do not need to take
                any further action on accessibility efforts.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In 2020, Adrian Roselli documented apparent attempts by
            accessiBe to interfere with WAVE as well.<a href="#ftn1" id="_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            Users of the WAVE tool had reported noticing anomalous behavior on sites which
            use the accessiBe product including anecdotal evidence that sites containing
            accessiBe would report no errors when obvious errors are present. As a result,
            the makers of WAVE needed to add a message within their product which states
            &quot;The 3<sup>rd</sup> party accessiBe integration on this page may
            temporarily modify content when WAVE is activated resulting in interference
            with WAVE's detection and of and accuracy identifying accessibility and
            compliance issues&quot;</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Accessibility Consultant Adrian Roselli further documented
            the existence of pieces of code within the accessiBe product that appear to
            validate the claim of accessiBe's interference with WAVE.  The code for
            accessiBe appears to have instances where it detects the use of WAVE, which
            triggers a function called <code>runWaveProcess</code>. The underlying code for that function has been
            obfuscated so
            its exact mechanism of operation cannot be determined but is assumed to be the code
            created to interfere with the WAVE tool.</p>

        <h2>Fake Reviews </h2>

        <p>In February 2021, WordPress.org removed dozens of fake
            reviews for accessiBe after the investigative work of Joe Dolson.<a href="#ftn2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> Dolson and
            members of WordPress.org's Plugin team investigated and found a pattern of
            suspicious behaviors indicating that the reviews were likely fake and removed
            them entirely.</p>

        <blockquote>Soliciting paid or fake reviews is
            not a new infraction, and it has been explicitly forbidden in the
            directory’s&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;for years. This falls under guideline #9<i>:
                Developers and their plugins must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or
                morally offensive</i>, which includes &quot;<i>Creating accounts to generate fake
                reviews or support tickets (i.e., sockpuppeting)</i>.&quot;<a href="#ftn3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a></blockquote>


        <h2>Native Advertising, Paid Articles, and Paid Reviews</h2>

        <p>Native advertising is the practice of placing an
            advertisement in with normal editorial content that is paid for by the
            advertiser. Typically, the advertisement looks like a normal article for the
            publication - it is a long form, promotional, and often non-critical
            description of the product or service being advertised.  Although the tactics
            used in native advertising vary, especially on the Web, they tend to share one
            or more of the following traits:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The article is ghost-written by the advertiser and the author
                byline uses a generic name, i.e., 'Admin' or the name of the website itself rather
                than the name of an actual person.
            </li>

            <li>The article is written by frequent contributor to the site who is
                paid to do so.
            </li>

            <li>The article author is an employee of the company whose product is
                being promoted.
            </li>

            <li>The article shows unconditional positive regard for the product
                being discussed, citing no alternate viewpoints, other sources, or competitors.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Although ethical news sources will often provide disclaimers
            about the paid nature of such content, the provision of such disclaimers is far
            less common on the Web. Even when they are provided, users may still be
            confused by them.<a href="#ftn4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a>
            In fact, a study by Bart Wojdynski and Nathaniel J. Evans found that only 20%
            of readers were aware that they were reading an advertisement even when a
            disclosure was present.<a href="#ftn5" id="_ftn5">[5]</a> 
            The likelihood of consumers becoming confused by such content is high enough
            that the FTC has issued an Enforcement Policy Statement in which they write:
            &quot; Such misleadingly formatted advertisements are deceptive even if the
            product claims communicated are truthful and non-misleading&quot;<a
                href="#ftn6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a></p>

        <p>Overlay vendors are particularly active in their use of
            native advertising, especially on websites of influencers, tech news websites,
            and blogs.  These articles continue the same common messaging themes
            perpetuated by the vendors themselves.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Although it is impossible to know whether an article is
            legitimate editorial content or an advertisement, the lack of unbiased critique
            or mention of competitors strongly indicates that many of the articles written
            about overlay products are paid for by the vendors of those products.</p>
