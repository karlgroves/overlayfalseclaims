        <p>False advertising harms consumers and is damaging to a fair
            marketplace. It is also illegal.</p>

        <blockquote>The Federal Trade Commission Act is
            the primary statute of the [Federal Trade] Commission. Under this Act &#8230; the
            Commission is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of
            competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce;
            (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers;
            (c) prescribe rules defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair
            or deceptive, and establishing requirements designed to prevent such acts or
            practices; (d) gather and compile information and conduct investigations
            relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities
            engaged in commerce&#8230; <sup><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>,<a
                href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

        <p>Under the Federal Trade Commission Act:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.</li>
            <li>Advertisers must have evidence to back up their claims;
                and
            </li>
            <li>Advertisements cannot be unfair.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In addition to false advertising being a violation of
            Federal law, all 50 states have legislation aimed at protecting consumers in
            their state from deceptive practices. 19 states have adopted the Uniform
            Deceptive Trade Practices Act<sup><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></sup>
            while the remaining states have their own, similar laws. The consumer
            protection laws in 49 states explicitly forbid false advertising.<sup><a
                href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="what-is-web-accessibility" tabindex="-1">What is Web Accessibility?</h3>

        <p>Web Accessibility, in simplest terms, is the extent to which
            people with disabilities can access websites and other web-based systems such
            as online retail and banking, web-based software necessary for their jobs,
            social media, and more.  While people with disabilities may require additional
            hardware or software (called Assistive Technologies) to facilitate that access,
            websites still must be designed and programmed properly so that the assistive
            technologies can accurately interpret and/ or facilitate the proper experience
            for the users. </p>

        <p>The criteria against which accessibility is typically measured
            is a standard known as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  The
            WCAG standard is developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group of the
            Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), the international standards body of the Web.
            This working group currently has 182 participants, including 32 invited
            experts, representing 57 organizations across the globe.  Version 2.0 of WCAG
            is recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/ IEC 40500:2012).  It is the basis for,
            or referenced by, 39 laws and policies around the globe.  In the United States,
            it is incorporated by reference in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and is
            often referenced in lawsuit filings, settlements, and consent decrees for the
            Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>

        <h2 id="false-advertising" tabindex="-1">False advertising among Web Accessibility Overlay vendors</h2>

        <h3 id="history-of-overlays" tabindex="-1">History and description of Overlays</h3>

        <p>The first tools for testing a website's accessibility were
            created not long after foundational work for the first version of WCAG (Web
            Content Accessibility Guidelines) - the predominant industry standard defining
            the requirements for accessibility on the Web - was created. Shortly after the
            final release of WCAG 1.0, products purporting to deliver automated compliance
            were created.  It did not take long before companies that were promoting automated compliance
            were being heavily criticized among those in the accessibility field as being misguided and for
            overstating their utility for people with disabilities<sup><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></sup>.
        </p>

        <p>Those early products almost always came in the form of small
            user interface controls that merely read the page's content aloud. Over time, similarly-positioned
            products would move to adding &quot;widgets&quot; which intend to function as
            on-page assistive technologies by adding controls to modify the features of the
            websites on which they were deployed. These controls do things like increase
            font size, change the contrast of the colors on the page, and change the
            appearance of certain types of content on the page.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/image001.png" alt="">

            <figcaption>Figure 1: Screenshot of the &quot;widget&quot; from
                UserWay. Nearly all overlays have their own version of this type of control set
                which offer so-called &quot;enhancements&quot; that change the display of the
                site upon which they are installed. Screenshot taken November 11, 2021
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>More recently, vendors of these products claim that their
            product can repair underlying code quality problems in the sites on which
            they're deployed and, further still, claim that they are using artificial
            intelligence to render websites compliant with laws and standards having to do
            with accessibility. </p>

        <p>These claims are poorly received by career professionals in the
            accessibility field. Over 600 people have endorsed a community-driven statement
            against overlay products called the Overlay Factsheet.<sup><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></sup>
            The
            list of signatories on the factsheet includes accessibility experts, disability rights
            advocates, lawyers, contributors &amp; editors for the technical specifications
            that run the Web itself, and most importantly, end users with disabilities. The
            list of signatories come from over 16 countries around the world.  In summary,
            the Overlay Factsheet's signers agree that:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Overlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in
                the technology stack.
            </li>
            <li>While some automated repair is possible, customers should
                be discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.
            </li>
            <li>While the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a
                handful of provisions in major accessibility standards, full compliance
                cannot be achieved with an overlay.
            </li>
            <li>Adding an overlay to your site may run counter to end
                users' preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with applicable
                [privacy] regulations.
            </li>
            <li>No overlay product on the market can cause a website to
                become fully compliant with any existing accessibility standard and
                therefore cannot eliminate legal risk.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Despite the above, deceptive marketing is almost universal among overlay vendors.</strong></p>

        <p>Below, we provide specific examples of false claims made by
            Overlay vendors. <sup><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a></sup>  In summary,
            the false claims made by overlay vendors fit into one of the following themes:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Adding the overlay product is the only thing the customer needs to
                do for accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>By using the overlay product, the customer's site will automatically become
                compliant with the ADA (and other relevant regulations and standards).
            </li>
            <li>By using the overlay product, the customer's site will automatically attain compliance
                in an extremely short period of time.
            </li>
            <li>By using the overlay product, the customer's website will automatically be
                accessible to everyone.
            </li>
            <li>By using the overlay product, the customer will automatically be shielded from
                litigation.
            </li>
            <li>The overlay product is the only one on the market that can make
                the customer's site compliant.
            </li>
            <li>The overlay product alone is sufficient in achieving compliance
                without any other work needed on the underlying code.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>In addition to the above, many of the overlay vendors also
            claim the following which are highly dubious at best, and outright lies at worst:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Improved usability.</li>
            <li>Increased rates of converting website visitors to
                purchasers.
            </li>
            <li>Exaggerated number of customers.</li>
            <li>Claiming name-brand customers who are not actually
                customers.
            </li>
            <li>Collaboration with 3<sup>rd</sup> parties with whom they
                have not collaborated with.
            </li>
            <li>The product is a sufficient alternative to specialized
                assistive technologies
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="evidence" tabindex="-1">Specific examples of false claims made by Overlay
            vendors</h2>

        <p>This section contains one example for each of the types of
            false claims made by overlay vendors. For the full list of gathered evidence
            and associated data, please see this document's appendixes.</p>

        <h3 id="claim1" tabindex="-1">Claim: Adding the product is the only thing the
            customer needs to do for accessibility</h3>

        <p>The most factually incorrect claim made by overlay vendors
            is that adding the product to their website is the only thing the customer
            needs to do for accessibility. </p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>In fact, no overlay product on the market can make a website
            fully accessible, much less conformant to major industry standards. While some
            overlay products can perform some behind-the-scenes repair of accessibility
            issues, the extent of those fixes are exceedingly small. Additionally, the
            &quot;widgets&quot; provided by overlays are most often a poorly executed
            attempt at replicating capabilities that already exist in the features of the
            user's browser and/ or operating system settings. </p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>The image below shows the EqualWeb product's font-size
            increasing feature. The EqualWeb product only provides an increase of up to
            150% while users of both Windows and macOS operating systems can increase
            system font sizes several times higher and offer additional capabilities to
            zoom the entire screen many times over.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/image002.png" alt="">

            <figcaption>Figure 2: Screenshot of the EqualWeb product after triggering the largest font size increase the
                product offers.  In this case it has increased the font size of text from 18px
                to 24px.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This does not prevent overlay vendors from making the claim -
            explicitly or implicitly - that adding their product to your site is the only
            thing you need to do. In the example below, Allyable says &quot;&#8230; we already
            did all the work for you!&quot; suggesting the site's owner doesn't need to do
            anything else to make their website accessible once Allyable is installed on
            the site.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/image003.png" alt="">

            <figcaption>Figure 3: Screenshot from Twitter status posted by Allyable
                stating: &quot;Need to make your digital assets accessible? No worries - we
                already did all the work for you!&quot;. Screenshot taken October 21, 2021
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 id="claim2" tabindex="-1">Claim: By using the product, the customer's site
            will become compliant with the ADA and other relevant regulations and
            standards.</h3>

        <p>Overlay vendors frequently cite the specific regulations and
            standards against which the customer's site will become compliant once
            installing the product.  This list includes the ADA, WCAG, and international
            regulations such as EN 301 549.</p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Because these products are incapable of repairing all
            accessibility issues on a website, it stands to reason that they are also
            incapable of delivering compliance with standards and regulations. Doing so
            with automated means is completely impossible for many reasons, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                There
                are no specific technical requirements for ADA Title III. While ADA-related
                lawsuits and settlements tend to agree on WCAG 2.1 Level AA, this is not
                codified by the law itself.
            </li>

            <li>
                Section
                508 and EAA/ EN 301 549 contain several items called &quot;Functional
                Performance Criteria<sup><a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></sup>&quot;. These criteria are
                typically very subjective, not clearly defined in a way that can be easily
                tested by machines, and heavily dependent on context.
            </li>

            <li>
                Some
                of the Success Criterion in WCAG relate to things that change on the page
                during user-triggered actions that cannot be detected by an overlay reliably
                enough to predict what action it should take to ensure compliance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>In the example below, Accessus.ai claims it is &quot;the
            only automatic solution&quot; and that it can bring sites into compliance with
            WCAG 2.1, ADA Title III, Section 508, EAA/EN 301 549<sup><a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></sup>.

        <p>Overlay vendors' marketing messaging preys upon the often-urgent
            nature of potential customers' needs and/ or the concern that making a website
            accessible will be difficult and take a long time.  The overlay vendors'
            messaging often contain such claims as:</p>

        </ul>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>As has already been established, these products cannot cause
            a website to become compliant on their own in any period, much less the
            extraordinarily short period of time they state in their marketing claims.  Effectively
            making an existing website compliant with WCAG can take several weeks to
            several months depending on the nature and size of the website and the number,
            nature, and severity of accessibility issues.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>The screenshot below, from UserWay, claims &quot;UserWay's
            solutions provide full WCAG &amp; ADA compliance from day one, and every single
            day thereafter&quot;.</p>

        <h3 id="claim4" tabindex="-1">Claim: By using the product, the customer's website
            will be accessible to everyone.</h3>

        <p>A frequent theme among overlay vendors isn't just that the
            customer's website will become compliant with major industry standards but that
            the site will become accessible to <strong><em>everyone</em></strong>. </p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Unfortunately, &quot;accessible to everyone&quot; is not
            possible:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some
                cognitive disabilities are difficult or impossible to design/ develop for.
            </li>

            <li>Some
                accessibility changes may benefit one population while decreasing usability for
                others.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>This is why assistive technologies exist. When deployed on
            the user's computer, either as hardware, software, or an alternate device
            altogether, the user with disabilities can choose the necessary assistive
            technology to assist with their specific needs.</p>

        <p>Due to the extreme levels of variance in the nature, causes,
            and severity of disabilities - and the possibility of a person having multiple
            disabilities - no overlay on the market can provide a complete solution and
            none have ever proven to come close.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>Due to the swift pace of litigation around Web Accessibility,
            customers who have been recently made aware of a lawsuit against them, or
            customers who are fearful of such a thing, are very receptive to the idea of
            having a product that can shield them from litigation.  Therefore, claiming
            that they can do so is a very common theme from overlay vendors.</p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Despite the marketing messages of overlay vendors, their
            claims of legal protection have been proven false. As shown in Appendix A, over
            200 companies have been sued in 2021 despite already having purchased an
            overlay. Of those lawsuits, the accessiBe product was present on 95 of those
            sites on the day the lawsuit was filed against the defendant.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <h3 id="claim6" tabindex="-1">Claim: The product is the only one on the market
            that can make the customer's site compliant.</h3>

        <p>Another common theme among overlay vendors is the claim that
            they are the <strong><em>only</em></strong> vendor whose product can render the customer's
            site compliant.  </p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Beyond the fact that these products don't do what they claim
            to, the claim that they're the only one who can do so is untrue. While the
            accessibility industry is quite small, there are several companies with the
            domain knowledge, tooling, and development capabilities necessary to make
            customers' sites accessible and compliant fully and completely with WCAG.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>On September 30, Allyable Tweeted &quot;Allyable is the only
            digital accessibility provider that gives an end-to-end solution&#8230; &quot;</p>

        <h3 id="claim7" tabindex="-1">Claim: The product alone is sufficient in achieving
            compliance without any other work needed on the underlying code</h3>

        <p>A popular refrain within overlay vendor's marketing is that &quot;one
            line of code&quot; is all that is needed. They claim that by adding one line of
            (JavaScript) code, which contains the overlay product's code, the site will become
            accessible. The follow-on claim, as shown below, is that there is nothing else
            that will need to be changed on the customer's site. </p>


        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>This claim would be true if the products did what the
            vendors claim they do, but that is not the case.  In fact, it has been proven<sup><a
                href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a></sup> that such
            products are unable to correct accessibility issues in the following types of
            content:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Images and other non-text-content
            </li>

            <li>
                Forms

            <li>
                Document heading structure

            <li>
                Keyboard accessibility and programmatic focus management
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>The below advertisement from UserWay states &quot;No changes
            to your website's Code. Fully Automated.&quot;</p>

        <h3 id="claim8" tabindex="-1">Claim: Increased conversion rates</h3>

        <p>&quot;Conversion&quot; is the point in time where a
            website's visitor performs a desired action that places them on the path toward
            becoming a paying customer.  Marketers measure conversion rates as a metric
            that helps determine the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. Some overlay
            vendors claim that you will increase traffic and/ or increase conversions
            simply by installing their product.  </p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Increasing a website's accessibility is often claimed to be
            a means to increase conversion, though most discussion on this topic is based
            on little more than conjecture.  Nobody, overlays vendors or anyone else, has
            ever provided sufficient evidence to prove that accessibility improvements
            alone will result in increased conversion rates.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>In the example provided below, ActiveIntent claims that you
            will increase conversions by 30% - a number that should be seen as ridiculous,
            in the strictest sense of the word, because a conversion rate of 30% is 4-7x
            more than what many marketers understand to be a good conversion rate.<sup><a
                href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a></sup></p>

        <h3 id="claim9" tabindex="-1">Claim: Exaggerated number of customers</h3>

        <p>According to Robert Cialdini,<sup><a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a></sup> Social Proof is
            one of the most powerful influencers. In e-commerce, the impression that a
            specific peer of high esteem has purchased your product can help influence a
            customer to buy.</p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>Overlay vendors frequently exaggerate the number of
            customers they have. By exaggerating this number, overlay vendors make their
            products seem to be more popular than they really are.  In fact, as shown in
            Appendix F, overlay vendors often overstate their market penetration 3-fold or
            more.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>In the example below, EqualWeb claims to be installed on
            100,543,679 web pages. In this case, &quot;web pages&quot;, as a term, is a bit
            ambiguous. One can reasonably assume that &quot;web pages&quot; is not the same
            as &quot;sites&quot;, which would be a collection of pages under a distinct
            domain.  However, according to data gathered for this report, the number of
            sites that have installed EqualWeb is close to 6000.  Even if we assume a
            rather generous 500 distinct pages per site, EqualWeb is still overstating
            their claim by over 300%. As shown in Appendix D these claims of market
            penetration can often be exaggerated significantly.</p>

        <h3 id="claim10" tabindex="-1">Claim: Specific brands as customers which are not</h3>

        <p>Like above, when it comes to Social Proof, a list of
            impressive customers can go a long way toward impressing those who may be
            similarly inclined to purchase the product. </p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>When it comes to overlay vendors, there's often a disconnect
            between their actual customer list and their claims.  They often use names,
            logos, and testimonials of impressive companies with which they do no actual
            business. Another tactic used is to add the logo of a multinational corporation
            on their site, lending the impression that the entire corporation is a
            customer, when only a small, local subsidiary is the customer.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>Allyable has an impressive list of logos on their home page
            under the heading &quot;Trusted By&quot;. Among the logos are companies like
            Diverse Ability Magazine, AudioCodes, Bank Hapoalim, and Microsoft, none of
            whom are Allyable customers.  In fact, 10 out of the 15 companies listed are <em>not</em>
            Allyable customers, 1 is a reseller, and 3 are customers of a reseller. In
            other words, only 1 of the companies listed is a direct customer of Allyable.</p>

        <h3 id="claim11" tabindex="-1">Claim: That the overlay widget is a suitable
            alternative to assistive technologies</h3>

        <p>The &quot;widgets&quot; that form the bulk of the
            functionality of overlay products present controls that transform the site's
            appearance and features in ways that they claim make the site more accessible
            to end users with disabilities.</p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>In nearly all cases, the &quot;enhancements&quot;
            facilitated by overlay products already exist on the user's computer when
            purchased. In Windows, these features are located under &quot;Ease of
            Access&quot; settings<sup><a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a></sup>,
            and in macOS they are in &quot;Accessibility&quot; within System Preferences<sup><a
                href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a></sup>.  Additionally,
            many accessibility preferences can be set within the user's browser. Users can
            also purchase specialized assistive technologies - both hardware and software -
            for their particular disability and preferences.</p>

        <p>The fundamental absurdity of overlay vendors claiming that
            their product is useful as an assistive technology is that the claim fails to
            acknowledge that their product is poorly placed in the technology stack:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If a user needs larger text on a website, they need larger text on all sites and
                applications
            </li>

            <li>
                If
                a user needs a high-contrast mode on a website, they need it on all sites and
                applications
            </li>

            <li>
                If
                a user needs text read aloud on a website, they need it on all sites and
                applications
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>The claim that the overlay widgets are useful in overcoming
            accessibility barriers strategically ignores the fact that users who <em>need</em>
            those features on a specific site will need those features to start the
            computer, open their browser, and navigate to the site in the first place.</p>

        <p>The last reason that these products are not a suitable
            alternative to assistive technologies is because they often do not perform as
            well as the user's built-in assistive technologies.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The
                font size adjustments often do not increase to the same levels. For example,
                Allyable, AudioEye, and UserWay only go to 200% while EqualWeb and MaxAccess
                only go to 150%. Built-in features for Windows and macOS go much larger.
            </li>

            <li>
                None
                of the overlay widgets' high contrast modes offer the variety, granularity, or
                customization capabilities of Windows or macOS
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>The most egregious example of this type of claim is the one
            below, from UserWay, who proclaims &quot;Unlike standard screen readers,
            UserWay's is engineered specifically for websites. Over 40 languages. Multiple
            reading speeds. A seamless experience for all.&quot;</p>

        <p>These claims are particularly deceptive because:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                As
                already mentioned, if a user needs a screen reader, they will need it to assist
                them in navigating to a website that has UserWay's product installed.
            </li>

            <li>
                The
                different languages that can be supported is dependent upon the speech
                synthesizer that is on the user's computer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Depending
                upon the supported speech synthesizers on a user's computer, JAWS and NVDA
                (&quot;standard&quot; screen readers implied by UserWay) can support
                approximately 80 languages.
            </li>

            <li>
                UserWay
                only supports 3 reading speeds (&quot;normal&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, and
                &quot;slow&quot;), whereas real screenreaders can typically offer specific
                word-per-minute granularity and some blind screenreader users can listen to
                their computers at 450 words per minute<sup><a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a></sup>.

        <h3 id="claim12" tabindex="-1">Claim: Collaboration with 3rd parties with whom they
            have not collaborated with</h3>

        <p>Another way an overlay vendor can use Social Proof to
            convince potential customers that their product is respectable is to claim that
            they've collaborated with others in the industry to drive innovation in their
            product.</p>

        <h4>The Truth</h4>

        <p>While there may be cases where overlay vendors are in
            contact with the general community of users, in many cases the accessibility
            field shuns overlay vendors. In June 2020, for instance, the National
            Federation for the Blind (NFB) went so far as to say, &quot;&#8230; the Board [of NFB]
            believes that accessiBe currently engages in behavior that is harmful to the
            advancement of blind people in society.&quot;<sup><a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a></sup></p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>On August 21, 2019, a representative from accessiBe, named
            Pamela, claimed that accessiBe had collaborated with JAWS developers on the
            accessiBe product, stating<sup><a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a></sup>:</p>

        <blockquote>For more than 18 months, our
            Research &amp; Development process focused on working back to back with people
            with different disabilities, even prior to our first live version. The process
            also included leading experts in accessibility, <strong>as well as a developer from
                the JAWS team whom, as you may know, is an eminence in screen-reader technology
                in the world today.</strong></blockquote>

        <p>According to blogger and accessibility consultant Adrian
            Roselli, this claim was false. He received communication from Vispero/ Freedom
            Scientific, the maker of JAWS, which stated: </p>

        <blockquote>&quot;Neither Vispero nor any of
            its developers have ever worked with accessiBe relative to any products and
            services.&quot; Roselli also identified two other instances in which accessiBe
            made this false claim.<sup><a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a></sup></blockquote>

        <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Although standards and technologies are available - and have been available - to make websites accessible for
            over 20 years, we still live in a world in which the majority of websites are designed without accessibility
            in mind. Consequentially, most websites contain significant challenges for people with disabilities.
            Thankfully governments understand how important Accessibility is for equitable access to the digital world
            and, as a result, every major economic region in the world has laws mandating accessibility. In the US we
            have laws such as the ADA, The Rehabilitation Act, CVAA, and Air Carrier Access Act. </p>

        <p>Federal, State, and Local government websites must comply with accessibility requirements. In recent years,
            lawsuits have resulted in a widespread recognition that most private companies must comply. For those who do
            not comply and who then receive legal complaints penalties can be painful. </p>

        <p>Providing a solution for this problem is a very healthy business model - especially if you can do it quickly,
            cheaply, and with minimal disruption to the existing User Interface. This is the false promise made by
            overlay vendors.</p>

        <p>The fact remains, however, that technology does not yet exist to cause an already existing website to become
            fully compliant with existing laws and standards without modifying the design, structure, and features of
            the site. This usually takes time, money, and disruption to the development process to insert the missing
            accessibility pieces. Accessibility experts provide consultation on these processes, helping companies
            establish new development processes such that their digital technologies become accessible each time from
            the beginning. </p>

        <p>Accessibility experts, advocates, and end users with disabilities agree that overlay products are not fit for
            task of ‘fixing’ inaccessible websites. Nonetheless, vendors of these products continue to traffic in false
            claims that they possess the technology to make a website accessible and eliminate the risk of a lawsuit due
            to disability discrimination.</p>

        <p>These false claims are insidious:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>While the false claims in the diet, fitness, or male enhancement industries prey on the buyer, the false
                claims of overlay vendors prey on the buyer while also facilitating discrimination against people with
                disabilities. Based on the evidence provided in this report, overlay vendors are in the practice of
                convincing their customers that all the customer needs to do is install their product for
                near-instantaneous, around-the-clock, full compliance with industry accepted accessibility standards and
                that, as a result, the customer will be protected against an accessibility-related lawsuit. Naturally,
                this means that the customer will pursue no additional means of ensuring that they are providing an
                accessible experience on their website. The result is that the customer's website is not made
                significantly more accessible and that end users with disabilities are still unable to gain full and
                equal access as required by law. In short, overlay products perpetuate discrimination against persons
                with disabilities through their false claims and should be held accountable.
            </li>
            <li>There is an industry of accessibility consultants and professionals who are working to help
                organizations to make more accessible websites through (what is widely considered to be) legitimate
                means. The costs to organizations to remediate their inaccessible content come in the form of payment
                for expert assistance; time for conducting a thorough job; and the provision of internal resources to
                adjust their previously accessibility-deficient development and testing processes. The false claims made
                by Overlay vendors (i.e., solutions are cheap, quick, and with minimal disruption) undermine legitimate
                accessibility consulting business practices. This is unfair competition. In addition, for the companies,
                their development and testing personnel who should be receiving accessibility training to enhance their
                own professional development are instead (unknowingly because of false advertising) receiving the false
                narrative that accessibility is ‘solved’ using an Overlay. This is antithetical to the
                underpinnings of the ADA and related laws, that accessibility should be a shared responsibility to solve
                a societal problem.
