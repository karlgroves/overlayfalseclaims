<h1>Appendix F: Claimed Market Penetration vs Reality</h1>

<p>This table shows the claimed number of sites upon which a
    vendor claims their product is installed on vs. the number estimated by a
    handful of data services which track the usage of technologies on the web as of
    November 6, 2021.  As shown below, for the claims we could find, all but
    AudioEye severely overstate their market penetration.  While it may be the case
    that some of their customers may not be accurately tracked (typically this
    would be the case because the customer's site is too small), there's little
    doubt that these vendors' claims are grossly overstated.</p>

<p>*  In the case of EqualWeb, the term they use is &quot;web
    pages&quot;.  We have generously assumed an average of 500 pages per site,
    though the reality on the web is that the average website contains far fewer
    pages than 500. However, we provide this number to make up for the possibility
    that some of the sites may be quite large. </p>
