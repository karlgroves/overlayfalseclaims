Of course, the fact that someone claimed something doesn 't make them right. With accessiBe, your website is indeed accessible and compliant and in the rare case of such a claim, we will provide you with everything you need to prove compliance. Here's how:  Once you have accessiBe installed, you will receive an accessibility statement. This statement outlines the adjustments accessiBe has made to your website, in terms of browser and assistive technology compatibility. It certifies that your website is compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines - which makes you compliant with all international accessibility standards!  In addition, accessiBe sends monthly compliance audit reports for each domain, which is another great asset to have to further prove that your website is fully accessible and compliant. We recommend downloading these monthly reports for proof of ongoing efforts to maintain compliance standards.  At this point, you should have enough to stop any lawsuit in its tracks. However, if the case still hasn 't been dropped then accessiBe offers a Litigation Support Package which includes documentation and testing from our R&amp;D team, suggested responses, and our ongoing support.

        <h3>Evidence from E-mail</h3>

            and WCAG guidelines&hellip;within 48 hours.&quot;</p>

We remediate websites according to ADA and WCAG guidelines.  Here's what do[sic]:  accessiBe scans and analyzes your website using AI technologies. Then, it appplies all required adjustments to become ADA and WCAG 2.1 compliant. This process takes up to 48 hours from installation.  The process of becoming compliant using our solution is very simple:  1. Install our single line of JS code. 2. Your website instantly displays our accessiblity interface. 3. Our AI starts scanning and analyzing your website. 4. In 48 hours, our AI is finished, and your webiste is compliant. 5. Our AI re-scans for new and revised content to process every 24 hours.  The accessibility interface solves 30% of the ADA and WCAG 2.1 requirements immediately.  This includes mostly UI and design features such as sizing, colors, and spacing.  The remaining 70% are solved within 48 hours, by our AI that runs in the background and adjusts your website, to make it operaable using a screen reader (for blind people) and the Keyboard[sic] (for the motor impaired).  The AI process includes several solutions: ALT (alternate text) attribute creation for images using image recognition and OCR technologies, form label creation and handling link/button icons using a contextual understanding technology, as well as fixing popups, menus, dropdown, forms, and more.  Please note: accessiBe will not change a thing for the majority of users. It will only be activated when turned on via the interface (or a Screen-reader if the user is blind), as an overlay to your website, and only to the user's specific session.  Therefore, accessiBe won't affect your design, UI, or perfomance at all.  The entire process is automated. From remediation to becoming compliant, no manual work is being done.  --  Elle from accessiBe Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated">

            <p>For years, web accessibility has

                set a goal to make all WordPress sites accessible, whatever it takes.</p>
