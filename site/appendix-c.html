<h1>Appendix C: Possible Native Advertising</h1>

<p>This table presents an incomplete list of native
    advertisements by overlay vendors. In most cases, the native advertising
    engaged in by overlay vendors does not contain at disclaimer that the content
    was paid-for, and therefore certainty of the pay-for-play aspect of these
    articles is not very high. That said, each of these articles share relatively
    common traits of native advertising.</p>
